#Hackbeanpot 2015, Team Third Space

This was the Mobile Implementation my friend and I created using OpenCV. Mapping spatial awareness and using gyrometers to 
detect motion we allowed users to walk in a virtual world using Google Cardboard and a mobile device. This was implemented for 
Android devices specifically and ported to Unity in C# 

We placed into the final round of judging. Being able to bring VR fully integrated into a virtual space was really something cool to do on mobile. It hadn't been done yet and could have some really cool uses in the future
