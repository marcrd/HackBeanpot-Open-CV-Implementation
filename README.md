This was the Mobile Implementation my friend and I created using OpenCV. Mapping spatial awareness and using gyrometers to 
detect motion we allowed users to walk in a virtual world using Google Cardboard and a mobile device. This was implemented for 
Android devices specifically and ported to Unity in C#
